    <summary class="details-text starting">What companies are good, and which ones to avoid?</summary>
    <div class="details-bg coll-content">
      <p>Sadly, this has to often be clarified to newcomers. Not everything in this hobby is perfect, and not everything is worth buying.<br>
        Listed are some notable manufacturers from both the good and the bad, so you can get an idea of what to expect <br><br>
        !!! I don't mean to bring hate towards any of these companies, I just want to provide beginners with the best experience !!!</p>
  
        <p>The good:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">TBS - </span>TBS have been in the game for a long time, mostly known for the Crossfire and Tracer radio systems,
            the Unify video system, and their great open source frames. But, as with all of the other FPV companies, their older offerings aren't worth it nowadays. Like the powercube system and the Oblivion quads</li>
          <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">RUSH - </span>One of the newer companies, RUSH have proven themselves to make great video transmission hardware.
            The Tank VTXs and antennas are great, and most of their Flight electronics work well too</li>
          <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Diatone - </span>Diatone was well known not too long ago as the go-to manufacturer for any kind of budget build,
            their hardware was great for the price back then. Now with the prices higher, it's less of a budget option, but they still make amazing stuff. Their old products aren't the greatest, but that's somehwat expected</li>
          <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">TMotor - </span>TMotor make mostly high-end stuff, from motors, to FCs and ESCs, as well as other bits.
            They've been making FPV stuff for a damn good while, and the quality of their products is great, although most of the time the cost reflects that</li>
        </ul>
  
          <p>The not-so-good:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Eachine - </span>Eachine have some good products, don't get me wrong. Like the EV800D/DM and EV300o goggles, and their tinywhoops.<br>
              But for anything bigger, it starts to fall apart. Most of the popular Tyro lineup is highly unreliable, maybe except the 119 and 129, but those are still outdated.
              Many beginners will stumble across some kind of the wizard x220, and all of its variants are pretty bad, at best you get a quad that may fall out of the sky,
              at worst it can start a fire. The EV100 goggles are also very popular, about as unreliable as the wizard, with the main cause of failure being overheating, sometimes straight up melting</li>
            <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">DarwinFPV - </span>Almost a full clone of most eachine quads, for some reason they can get the cost down hilariously low.
              If you don't get your expectations up, some of those quads can be pretty good for the very low price if you really want to. But I'd recommend getting something proper</li>
            <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Racerstar - </span>Another one of the "too cheap to be good" manufacturers, you do get what you pay for.
              The motors aren't built well, they are underspecced, and they don't last. Their electronics aren't much better, with the ESCs and FCs being about as disposable as props</li>

    <summary class="details-text starting">How much does it cost to get into FPV?</summary>
    <div class="details-bg coll-content">
      <p>This all just depends on the budget that you have. FPV can get pretty expensive pretty damn fast, so you should know what you're getting into. <br>
        A good rule of thumb is to not get anything you can't immediately afford to get replacement parts.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">$20 - </span>Cheapest you can get a feel for flying... if you already have a game controller and a gaming station. Buy a sim, and try flying to see if FPV is even something you'd enjoy</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">$70-$100 - </span>For this price you can get a hobby-grade radio, that will give you a much more realistic feel when flying in a simulator, and can be used if/when you decide to get a quad</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">$300-400 -</span> Cheapest you can reasonably get flying for real. This will get you a whoop to fly indoors, a proper radio, and some budget goggles to start off</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">$500-600 - </span>Cheapest you can get a 5" setup for. Same radio and goggles, but the quad will obviously be more epxensive</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">~$700 - </span>This is where I would aim for with a solid analog setup. You'd get good slimline goggles, a good charging setup and tools, and a proper quad</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">~$800 - </span>Pretty much the top end for analog as it gets, I wouldn't really go any further without going on DJI Digital</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">$1000+ - </span>About the most you can reasonably spend. DJI FPV, and high end radio equipment</li>

    <div class="details-bg coll-content">
      <p>A lot of things in FPV have established names, terms, and acronyms. These are most often used for physical stuff on the drone itself, or stuff to go along with it</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Quad - </span>Short for quadcopter, when talking about drones it makes you sound smarter, and it's faster/easier</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">RX - </span>Usually used when reffereing to a receiver, also an RX pad on a flight controller which is used for serial communication</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">TX - </span>Used in many places, such as when reffereing to the remote controller, a TX pad on the flight controller that is used for double-sided serial communication, 
          and also rarely when talking about the video transmitter</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">VTX - </span>Video transmitter. The V stands for, well, video, and TX for transmitter, as above</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">VRX - </span>Video receiver, basically a module that plugs into some high end goggles to give video reception</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">FC - </span>Flight Controller</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">ESC - </span>Electronic Speed Controller</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Radio - </span>used when talking about the remote controller</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">LiPo - </span>Lithium-Polymer. Most common type of battery used for FPV quads. They can have a high output rating, and so fit great for high current applications, such as quads</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Li-Ion - </span>Lithium-Ion. Lower output, higher capacity. Most often sold as round cells, in 18650 or 21700 sizes. Used to power goggles, radios, 
          and lower current aircraft, such as planes, or long range efficency quads</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">PSU - </span>Power Supply. Used to power chargers, as most don't have an internal circuit to convert high AC voltage coming from the wall to the lower DC voltage. 
          Vary in output power, measured in watts. A higher rated PSU for a charger will only leave extra headroom, it won't harm the charger or whatever may be connected to it</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">XT90/60/30 - </span>Main battery connector used for FPV aircraft. XT30 is for light/small drones, xt60 is for bigger, heavier quads, 
          and xt90 is only for the heaviest and biggest quads or other form of aircraft</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">PCB - </span>Printed Circuit Board. The base for any electronics, FPV or not. Every electronical part sits on it, and it provides a structure for all the connections to be made</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Prop - </span>Short for propeller</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">(RP-)SMA - </span>A type of antenna connector, most often on goggles, 5" and above quads, and on most antennas</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">MMCX - </span>Also an antenna connector, used on the VTX side. Often adapted to SMA for durability and ease of removal</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">u.fl - </span>Pretty much the same as MMCX, only that it's smaller, and uses a different mounting mechanism</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">IPEX - </span>Very similar to u.fl, but most often used on receivers</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">PDB - </span>Power Distribution Board. These are pretty outdated now, as people use 4in1 ESC boards. They were used in the past to route power to individual ESC boards, 
          but now as said before they are kinda obsolete on most quads, still used in bigger applications, and exotic setups</li>

      <p>A lot of things in FPV have established names, terms, and acronyms. These are used when reffereing to software, and anything not physcially bound</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">BF - </span>Short for Betaflight, the main software used to configure the drone, and the firmware running on the drone</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">FW - </span>Short for Firmware. Runs on all kinds of electronics, defining how they function</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">DShot - </span>Wire protocol used for communication between the FC and ESC, can run at different update rates</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">SBUS - </span>Wire protocol for communication between the FC and mainly FrSky receivers, originally used for digital servos, but now used for serial one wire communication</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">S.Port - </span>Wire protocol, also used by FrSky receivers, used alongside SBUS for sending telemetry back to the radio</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">F.Port - </span>SBUS and S.Port over one wire, not two. On compatible receivers it needs a different firmware</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">IBUS - </span>Wire protocol used by FlySky, similar to SBUS, but is not inverted. Also used for FlySky digital servos at first, now kinda useless</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">BlHeli - </span>firmware and ESC type. Older ESCs use BlHeli_S which is open, and so has custom configurators and firmware made for it, newer ESC's use BlHeli_32, 
          which is closed, so it doesn't have as much custom stuff for it. Both are widely used nowadays, and BlHeli_S is often cheaper, and doesn't have that many downsides</li>

          a 51433 prop will be 5.1" blade length, and 4.33" pitch. With the exception being HQ, they name their props like 5x3.6x3,

    <summary class="details-text starting">How to charge and take care for batteries?</summary>
    <div class="details-bg coll-content">
      <p>Batteries can very quickly go up in flames if you don't care for them properly. The chances of that are almost zero if you just take some safety precautions. 
        There are charger and battery recommendations down the line, so you should have a good base of what to get.<br> When you first get your charger, it is a good idea to calibrate it, 
        if you have a multimeter. <br>When it comes to charging, you should set the charger to the correct battery type, for most FPV batteries that will be LiPo. 
        The charger should show 4.2V maximum voltage. Enter in your cell count, and then get the charge current in.<br><br>
        As talked about above, the C rating is used to calcualte the current going in/out of the battery. 
        The calculation is Capacity(Ah)×C=A. So for a 1300mah battery charging at 1C, you would set the charge current to 1.3A (1.3Ah×1C=1.3A), 
        for a 1500mah battery charging at 2C it would be 3A (1.5A×2C=3A), etc... <br><br>
        For the voltage, you might make the mistake of reading the nominal voltage, which is printed on the battery itself. So for a 4s battery, you might think that you 
        should be charging it to 14.8V, but that is wrong. The nominal voltage rating is the aproximate "50%" charge of the battery, 3.7V per cell. What you actually want to use is the max voltage, 
        which is 4.2V multiplied by the cell count. For a 4s battery, that would be 16.8V (4.2V×4), for 6s that's 25.2V, and for 1s it might be a little different depending on if you have an 
        HV cell or a normal one. HV cells are almost the same as the normal ones, but they have been tested to not explode whencharged to higher voltages. HV batteries have a max voltage of 4.35, and a nominal voltage of about 3.85V<br><br>
        Plug in the battery, with both the main xt60 connector, and the balance plug into their respective portson the charger. You can then start the charge. 
        At 1C, a full charge should take about an hour. 1C is the optimal charge current, but if need be, you can go higher. 
        This shouldn't damage the battery all that much, but it is always better to charge at 1C.

      <p>No matter if you are building a quad, getting one pre-made, or anything between, you will need tools to fix it/actually build it. 
        There are a lot of tools you'll need, some more needed than others. To get you started just get a prop tool, a soldering iron, and a set of 1.5mm-3mm hex drivers. 
        That should be good enough for the time being.<br><br>
        You might then also want tweezers (or forceps) to hold wires when soldering, 
        nut wrenches to get nuts out of harder-to-reach places, and maybe some helping hands for holding boards when soldering, as well as a multimeter to measure for continuity, 
        a smoke stopper to make sure that you won't put your new build in danger if you mess something up.<br>
        For ease of soldering, I'd get some flux gel, or a flux pen, proper rosin core 60/40 or 63/37 solder, and ideally a nice soldering iron with easily changeable tips, and tempreature control</p>

    <summary class="details-text building">What kind of quad should I get?</summary>
    <div class="details-bg coll-content">
      <p>All just depends on what you want to do. There are quads you can build ranging anywhere from a little thing that fits in your palm, and can be safely flown almost anywhere, 
        up to copters that can lift cinema-grade cameras.<br><br>
        
        For general use, a 5" quad is probably your best bet, you can either get a race, freestyle, ultralight, or a cinematic quad 
        (use is kinda self explanatory). The main difference between those is that freestyle frames are heavier, and more durable than racing frames, 
        and cinematic frames will have props out of view of the camera, ultralights will fit under 250g, or at least be close to that limit<br><br>
      
        There are also cinewhoops, which are protected 3" quads that can be safely flown around other people, while still carrying an action camera. 
        You can get a bunch of different 3" quads, usually in the same "categories" as 5" mentioned above. These are great if you have less space, or don't need to carry a GoPro.
        Or just go for a little tinywhoop, usually only flown indoors (or outside if there is absolutely no wind), but they're still tons of fun, especially if winter hits.<br><br>
    
        If you really feel like stepping it up, get a 7" quad that can carry heavier batteries, and fly for much longer with the same payload. 
        Or take it even further, and get a cinelifter. <br><br>!!! These quads should only be used by professionals though, and the price reflects that as well !!!

      <p>This varies from quad to quad, and there aren't many things that stay constant. But for example, on a 5" quad, you'd be looking at 2207/2208/2306/2307 sized motors, 
        probably a 30x30, 25x25, or a 20x20 stack, a mini or micro camera, ideally 6s batteries. <br>
        For a 3" quad the motors change a lot depending on the use, but you'd have a 25x25 or a 20x20 stack, and a micro camera. <br>
        As you get lower in size, you will need smaller and smaller parts, so for a whoop you'd have 0802 motors, a 25x25 AIO, and a pico camera<br>

    <summary class="details-text building">How to choose parts that will be compatible?</summary>
    <div class="details-bg coll-content">
      <p>There are a couple of things you need to look out for when choosing compatible parts. We're lucky that a lot of the stuff out there is compatible with each other, 
        but there are also some exceptions. As long as you read carefully, you should be fine with compatibility<br><br>
      
        The main things you should always look for is if your frame would fit the FC/ESC/VTX, as well as all the other parts you might put in. 
        Camera size is also important to make sure you get right. There are pre-established size standards though, so that makes it a bit easier. 
        Cameras are (from biggest to smallest): Full-size (28x28), Mini (21x21), Micro (19x19), Nano (14x14), and Pico (12x12). 
        For FC's/ESC's/VTX's, it's (again from biggest to smallest, the numbers are in mm): 30x30 (full), 25x25 (whoop mount), 20x20 (micro), and 16x16 (nano)
        Same goes for motors. There are motors that have screw spacing of different sizes, and you need to make sure that it will fit what your frame has.<br>
        With the somewhat recent entry of Digital systems, you should also make sure that you're getting into the correct system. Analog goggles for analog 
        cams/VTXs, DJI goggles for the DJI Air Units, etc...<br><br>
    
        There is also electronical compatibility. Some parts can only take a certain voltage, and some need specific ports on your FC, like I2C - SDA and SCL

    <div class="details-bg coll-content">
      <p>First off you should get an adjustable-tempreature soldering iron, because you want to have control over the tempreature. 
        I prefer ~380C for regular stuff, ~420C for bigger joints, like battery or motor pads. Get some good rosin core leaded solder, either 60/40 or 63/37. 
        If you don't know which brands to choose from, TBS solder is a good pick if nothing else is available. Also helps to have a cleaning wetsponge or cleaning brass wool, 
        and some flux. Doesnt matter if it's the paste, gel, or pen type, all work great to make it much easier and cleaner<br><br>
      
        Start by tinning the tip, which makes the heat transfer much easier. Apply flux to the pad(s) you will be soldering to. Get the iron on the pad, heat it up for a short while, 
        and push the tin wire under the soldering iron tip. Pull off the iron, and check if it looks good. You should have a round, shiny "dome" of solder on the pad. 
        If it isn't shiny, try higher tempreature and/or a bit more flux, if it isn't round try to add more solder and flux

        It also helps to have quality hardware on hand when you want to build a quad, so proper bolts, nuts and nyloc nuts are very useful to have in a lot of sizes. 
        If you want an easy and cheap cosmetic uplift, you can also get them in various colors. I especially like the look of countersunk bolts with colored countersunk washers ;)

    <div class="details-bg coll-content">
      <p>Most frames nowadays come with some kind of mount that either holds a regular SMA connector, or one of the "Unify" style ones with the two holes on either side. 
        I Highly prefer those over the normal ones, because the round ones tend to spin out and damge themselves when you tighten them. 
        The unify ones prevent that when also screwed in with the two m3 holes. If you have the option to use those, defiently use them instead.
      </p>
      <p>For receiver antennas, it depends on what you want to do, and what kind of antenna you have.<br>
        For normal 2.4ghz antennas, having them on zipties pointing back from the front arms is usually the way to do it.
        For 900mhz "immortal T" antennas, you can either have it on the arm, in the back, or in the front with a holder. For best range it's better to have it in the front, 
        but that can make it less durable. In the back it's the safest, and on the arm it's the easiest.
        For the new 2.4ghz "mini T" antennas, it's almost the same as the 900mhz ones, but since they're smaller, you can fit them in more places, 
        so you can get pretty creative with the way you mount them

        If you're building a lighter quad, it's better to go with high kv motors and low pitch props, and for a heavier quad go with lower kv and higher pitch props.

        There are some things you want to change there too though. Mainly the channel order, and the RSSi channel if you're runnin a receiver that has RSSi on an aux channel. 
        The channel order can be different from TX to TX, so you might want to look your specific one, or just change the order of the letters until it does match up with the stick input

    <div class="details-bg coll-content">
      <p>First step is to find out what SA version your VTX supports. The manufacturer will often have this listed on their website, or on the product listing itself. 
        Once you have that, you can load in a generic VTX table for that version, and then modify the values if needed, stuff like output power, and maybe the channels if they are missing. <br><br>
        The other way is much easier. Some bigger manufacturers will have VTX tables ready for download for the specific VTX, so you just load that in, and it should work.

    <summary class="details-text betaflight">How to set up GPS return to home?</summary>
    <div class="details-bg coll-content">
      <p>It is pretty easy to set up basic GPS, but dialing in RTH settings might be more difficult. To get GPS working, you just need to wire it up correctly to a spare UART on the FC. 
        Then in betaflight, in the ports tabunder that UART you want to select GPS in the Sensors dropdown, and keep the baud rate as is. Most oft he actual setup is done in the configuration tab. 
        There, enable GPS, set the protocol to UBLOX (NMEA if UBLOX isn't working), enable autoconfig, and you can enable auto baud rate, 
        but ideally you should have this value from the manufacturer <br><br>
        As for RTH, this can be up to preference, like how fast it should return, how high should it go before returing, etc... All of these settings are in the Failsafe tab. 
        First you need to enable GPS RTH Failsafe, and then you can set your parameters. These are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Minimum Satellites - </span>How many sats are needed beforet he quad can even arm. Once this value is higher than what you set, 
          the quad will be ready to arm. Usually it's better to have it above 6, but the more, the better.</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Altitude Mode - </span>Will change how the altitude is used to return back home. <br>
            Maximum altitude will use the highest altitude that the quad was in during the flight. <br> Fixed value is just a simple height in meters. <br> 
            And current altitude will just head straight back without climbing up</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Initial Altitude (meters) - </span>The height the quad will go to before returing. You want this to be high enough to avoid all obstacles, but low enough where it's still in range.</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Descent distance (meters) - </span>At what distance from the set home point the quad will go down. Set this to where you would be able to get back into the TX range.</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Angle - </span>At which angle the quad will tilt forward when going home.</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Ground speed (meters/second) - </span>How fast the quad will go in relation to the ground. Keep in mind that this is in m/s.</li>
        <li class="faq-list"><span class="li-highlight">Throttle Min/Max/Hover - </span>The throttle channel values it will use for the whole RTH process. Keep Min high enough thaht the props spin fast enough, 
          keep Max low enough so that it isn't too fast, and set hover to the approximate value that the quad will hover at</li>

    <summary class="details-text betaflight">My motors won't stop spinning after zero throttle</summary>
    <div class="details-bg coll-content">
      <p>This is called I Term Windup. The quad will want to have control over it's movement 100% of the time. If it can't move, it'll add throttle constantly to try and move itself. 
        So it keeps adding more and more until you disarm. As said, this happens when the quad can't move correctly for any kind of reason. 
        Props removed/not installed correctly, motor direction wrong, FC orientation set incorrectly, etc... basically anything that might be spinning wrong</p>
