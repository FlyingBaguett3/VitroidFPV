<h2 class="content page-header">Light, fast, and agile for tight turns and fast movements</h2>

<p class="content normal-text">Race quads are usually built up to a specified standard for bigger, more official races, or no-standard for smaller races/practice.<br> 
  You will often see taller, high kv motors. 2207, 2207.5, 2208, 1800-2000kv paired with 20x20 stacks, lower outpt VTX's and low latency cameras and radio systems. <br><br>
  This list will include both standards, from budget to premium. I haven't included cameras/radio systems, as those are largely up to preference.<br> Prices may depend on where you source the parts. (Prices and specs are sourced from the manufacturers website when possible)<br>
