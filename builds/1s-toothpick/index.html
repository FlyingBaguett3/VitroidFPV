  Only analog video, 1s AIO flight controllers, maybe even with an integrated VTX, tiny motors (from 0802 to 1103 and alike), pico cams, and push-on props.<br>
  This list will include both standards, from budget to premium. I haven't included cameras/radio systems, as those are largely up to preference.<br>
  Prices may depend on where you source the parts. (Prices and specs are sourced from the manufacturers website when possible)<br>
  You can check out more info on the parts by clicking on the names, which are color coded by the price range. These are not affiliate links for your, and my convenience.<br><br>
  !!! There is variety between the motors and frames in the motor mount size and pattern, you need to check that it will fit before ordering !!!
